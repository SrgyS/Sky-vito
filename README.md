# Sky-Vito App

This application was developed as my final project for the Skypro web development course. It serves as a platform for posting and managing advertisements.

For unauthorized users, the application provides the ability to view advertisements, search by name, explore the seller's profile, and leave comments.  
For authorized users, additional features include the ability to add, edit, and delete advertisements, as well as the option to modify user profile information.  
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience across various devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
